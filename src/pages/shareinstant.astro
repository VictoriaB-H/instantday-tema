              Every submission has to be an analogue instant photo - not a

              made in various ways, with analogue instant cameras, digital
              instant cameras like ie. the Fujifilm EVO or scan-and-print tools
              like ie. the Polaroid Lab. The instant photo can be manipulated
              with analogue processes - the organizers encourage instant
              photography experiments. The submission can depict the instant
              photo in many ways: As a flat scan without or without the instant
              photo frame, as a photo showing the instants in a frame, on the
              wall etc. The instant doesn’t need to be just one photo: It can be
              a panorama or collage of multiple instants that make up one
              submission.
